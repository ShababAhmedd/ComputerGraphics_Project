# Dynamic Urban Scene Visualization using OpenGL in Python

## Description

This project is a time-based urban scene simulation developed using Python and PyOpenGL. It visualizes a city skyline with dynamic background colors and animated sun movement depending on the hour of the day (military time input from 0â€“24). The simulation includes:

- Buildings with detailed shapes
- A sun that moves and changes size/color throughout the day
- Sky that gradually changes shades
- Implementation of custom midpoint line and circle drawing algorithms with zone conversion logic

It showcases fundamental concepts of computer graphics such as 2D transformations, symmetry, pixel plotting, and OpenGL-based rendering.
